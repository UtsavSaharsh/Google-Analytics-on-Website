# Google-Analytics-on-Website

Google Analytics on Website is a simple HTML and CSS-based project that demonstrates how to integrate Google Analytics into a static website. The website files uploaded in this repository include a basic structure and styling, and most importantly, the Google Analytics tracking code embedded directly in the HTML file. This integration allows real-time monitoring of website traffic, user behavior, and other important performance metrics through the GA4 dashboard.

After setting up the GA property in Google Analytics, the Measurement ID is added to the website using the provided gtag.js script in the <head> section of the HTML. Once deployed, the integration can be verified using tools like Google Tag Assistant and real-time reports in GA4. The goal of this project is to showcase how even a basic static website can be enhanced with powerful analytics tools to track and analyze visitor interactions, which is essential for improving user experience and making data-driven decisions.
